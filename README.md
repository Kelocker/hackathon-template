# üìò Project Setup Instructions

This project uses **Docker + Docker Compose** to run a full-stack app with a **React frontend** and a **Flask backend**.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Use This Template

1. Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of the page
2. Create your own repository based on this template

</p>


---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Build and Run the App with Docker

After cloning your repository into your machine, run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open your browser and check:

- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend: [http://localhost:5000/api/hello](http://localhost:5000/api/hello)

‚úÖ Both should be running fine.

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Changing GitHub Action (Optional)

<details>
<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer (Please read)</summary>

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow set to **manual-only** (`workflow_dispatch`).  
No automated workflows will run during cloning, pushing, or using this template ‚Äî unless a user explicitly chooses to run them.

If you click **"Run workflow"** or manually enable automatic workflows  
(e.g., by renaming `.github/workflows/docker-composer-autobuild.txt` to `.yml`),  
you are doing so **at your own discretion** and accept full responsibility for any usage, billing, or side effects.

This template is provided as-is. I maintain versioning and structure, but I am **not responsible** for:
- GitHub Actions billing  
- Workflow behavior (e.g., broken Docker builds)  
- Security or compliance of any changes made after using this template

</details>

<details>
<summary>‚öôÔ∏è What the Manual GitHub Action Does (By opening this, you agree to the disclaimer above)</summary>

When you click **‚ÄúRun workflow‚Äù** in the Actions tab, the workflow:

1. Checks out the current branch  
2. Sets up Docker with BuildKit support  
3. Runs `docker compose build`  
   ‚Üí This builds the **frontend and backend images** using the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`

> ‚úÖ No containers are run  
> ‚ùå No tests or deployments  
> üîí Only builds ‚Äî safe for checking Docker config


>‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Running this workflow will consume GitHub Actions minutes.
>Please be mindful of usage if you're on a free plan without GitHub Education or Pro benefits.
>Refer to the disclaimer above for more details on usage, responsibility, and billing.

</details>

<details>
<summary>‚öôÔ∏è What the Automatic GitHub Action Would Do (By opening this, you agree to the disclaimer above if re-enabled)</summary>

If you rename `.github/workflows/docker-composer-autobuild.txt` to `.yml`,  
this workflow will be automatically triggered on:

- ‚úÖ Any `push` to any branch  
- ‚úÖ Any pull request targeting the `main` branch (excluding `.md` or documentation-only changes)

### üîß What it does:

Automatically runs on code-related changes (excluding markdown and docs):

1. **Checks out the current branch**  
2. **Sets up Docker with BuildKit support**  
3. **Runs** `docker compose build`  
   ‚Üí This builds both the **frontend** and **backend** images using the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Behavior:

- This workflow will **run every time code is pushed or a pull request is opened**
- If the Docker build fails (e.g., due to code errors or misconfigurations), the workflow will **fail**
- This **consumes GitHub Actions minutes**, even if the push is small

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Enable this only if you are confident in your Docker setup  
> and accept the billing and runtime implications of automated workflows.  
>
> üìå **Refer to the disclaimer above for full details regarding usage responsibility and billing.**

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Start Coding

You can now edit your code in your editor ‚Äî Docker will reflect the changes automatically via volume mounting.

---

### üîÅ After Pulling Updates from GitHub

Always rebuild after pulling code to ensure updates (especially dependencies) are applied:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

---

### üßº Optional: Clean Up Occasionally

If you‚Äôve been switching branches or running lots of containers/images:

```bash
docker system prune -a --volumes -f
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This removes **all unused containers, images, volumes, and networks**. Use with care.
